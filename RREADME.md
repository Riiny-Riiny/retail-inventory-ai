\# retail-inventory-ai

A step-by-step portfolio project demonstrating how to optimize retail inventory management by combining traditional analytics, machine learning forecasting, transformer fine-tuning, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q\&A system.

\#\# Project Description

SmartInventoryAI is an end-to-end proof-of-concept showing how small retailers can leverage data-driven techniques to:

1\. \*\*Understand current operations\*\*    
   \- Compute key performance indicators (turnover, days-on-hand, ABC classification)    
   \- Visualize SKU-level patterns and identify outliers

2\. \*\*Forecast demand\*\*    
   \- Use both statistical (ARIMA/Prophet) and machine-learning (XGBoost/LightGBM) approaches    
   \- Compare model accuracy (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) and select a winner

3\. \*\*Fine-tune a transformer for classification\*\*    
   \- Label SKUs as “fast movers” vs. “slow movers” based on turnover percentiles    
   \- Fine-tune DistilBERT/T5 on product descriptions to automate reorder urgency

4\. \*\*Build a Retail-specific RAG system\*\*    
   \- Index your CSV data and process documentation with Sentence-Transformers \+ FAISS    
   \- Serve up answers to questions like “When should I reorder SKU 123?” via a simple CLI or notebook

By walking through these phases, you’ll showcase skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, time series, supervised fine-tuning, embeddings, vector search, and prompt-based generation—packaged in interactive Jupyter Notebooks and a lightweight demo.
